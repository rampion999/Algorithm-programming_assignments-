# Run it
- `java KdTreeVisualizer` computes and draws the 2d-tree that results from the sequence of points clicked by the user in the standard drawing window.
- `java RangeSearchVisualizer {input1K.txt}` reads a sequence of points from a file (specified as a command-line argument) and inserts those points into a 2d-tree. Then, it performs range searches on the axis-aligned rectangles dragged by the user in the standard drawing window.
- `java NearestNeighborVisualizer {input1K.txt}` reads a sequence of points from a file (specified as a command-line argument) and inserts those points into a 2d-tree. Then, it performs nearest-neighbor queries on the point corresponding to the location of the mouse in the standard drawing window.
